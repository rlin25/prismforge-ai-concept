# PrismForge AI Enterprise - Security & Compliance Guide

## Executive Summary

PrismForge AI Enterprise Edition is designed for large consulting firms, investment banks, and corporate development teams handling sensitive M&A data. This comprehensive security framework ensures enterprise-grade protection, regulatory compliance, and audit readiness.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Every database table enforces organization-level isolation
- Complete data separation between organizations
- Zero-trust security model with no shared data access
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

```sql
-- Example RLS Policy
CREATE POLICY "organization_isolation" ON analysis_sessions
    FOR ALL USING (
        user_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM users 
            WHERE organization_id = (
                SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
            )
        )
    );
```

**Authentication Security**
- JWT tokens with cryptographic signatures
- Session management with database validation
- Automatic session expiry and refresh
- Secure cookie handling with httpOnly and secure flags

**Data Encryption**
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all API communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for database storage
- **Application**: Encrypted sensitive fields using database functions
- **Backups**: Encrypted backup storage with key rotation

### Enterprise Authentication

**Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**
- Google Workspace OAuth 2.0
- Microsoft Azure AD (Office 365)
- SAML 2.0 ready for enterprise IdP systems
- Domain-based user provisioning and validation

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Integration with corporate MFA systems
- Device trust and registration
- Risk-based authentication triggers
- Session verification for sensitive operations

**Security Configuration**
```typescript
const enterpriseSecurityConfig = {
  authentication: {
    ssoRequired: true,
    mfaRequired: true,
    sessionTimeout: 8, // hours
    maxSessionDuration: 24, // hours
    deviceTrustRequired: true
  },
  access: {
    ipWhitelist: ['192.168.1.0/24'], // Optional
    geofenceEnabled: true,
    offlineAccessBlocked: true,
    downloadPrevention: true
  },
  audit: {
    allActionsLogged: true,
    immutableLogs: true,
    realTimeAlerts: true,
    complianceReporting: true
  }
};
```
